# Minesweeper

## Description

In the spring semester of my freshman year, I recreated the Minesweeper game as part of the final project for CMP 168. This GUI-based project aimed to recreate the popular game while providing an engaging and user-friendly experience. The primary goal was to implement the game in a graphical interface, allowing players to enjoy the game on their computers. 

### Key Features

- A graphical representation of the Minesweeper grid with clickable cells.
- Randomized bomb placement, ensuring a unique and unpredictable experience in every game session.
- When a user clicks on a cell that has a 0 count reveal adjacent cells as follows: All adjacent and connected 0 cells are revealed, All (non-bomb) cells immediately adjacent to the revealed 0 cells are also revealed.
- When the game is over the user should be informed via JOptionPane whether they won or lost and be offered the option to play again.
